CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:26 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findvelocity_msg.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "velocity_msg", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "velocity_msg" with
  any of the following names:

    velocity_msgConfig.cmake
    velocity_msg-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "velocity_msg" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "velocity_msg_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "velocity_msg" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
